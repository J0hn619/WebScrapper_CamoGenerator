I made a Webscraper & Camo generator. The first script will pull images from a website ( not Facebook unfortunately because it’s against the tos). The second script generates two layers, the first is a background camo with colors based on a color slider / hex code ui. The second layer scatters 3-5 of the images from the Webscraper into groups of 25-100 and distributes them at various sizes. I did the first version in one day here:
👍 Took quite a bit of debugging but I’m pleased with the results
